# evolving-multi-layer-perceptron
Evolving a MLP (Mutli-Layer Perceptron) artificial neural network that is used to control a fleet of identical spacecraft. The objective is to evolve a single controller that is able to land the fleet safely regardless of their different starting positions and starting velocities.
